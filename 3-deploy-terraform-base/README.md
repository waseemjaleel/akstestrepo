# Deploy Terraform Base

This lab is the first part of deploying terraform, known as base; it will deploy:
- Resource Group
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Log Analytics
- Application Insights 

This will then allow us to move to [Lab 4 Deploying the application to Azure Container Registry](https://github.com/thomast1906/deploy-first-containerapp-terraform/tree/main/4-Build-deploy-application-to-ACR)
